## Getting started

A Stimulus controller to add a progress bar when scrolling.

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn add stimulus-scroll-progress
```

And use it in your JS file:
```js
import { Application } from "stimulus"
import ScrollProgress from "stimulus-scroll-progress"

const application = Application.start()
application.register("scroll-progress", ScrollProgress)
```

## Usage

Add a `div` just after the `body` opening tag:

In your view:
```html
<body>
  <div data-controller="scroll-progress" class="h-2 bg-indigo-400 fixed top-0"></div>
</body>
```

It's up to you to design it as you want.

## Configuration

To improve performance, the `scroll` event is [throttled](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#throttle).

| Attribute | Default | Description | Optional |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- | -------- |
| `data-scroll-progress-throttle-delay` | `15` | Delay in milliseconds to update the scroll position. (`0` to disable). | âœ… |

## Extending Controller

You can use inheritance to extend the functionality of any Stimulus component:

```js
import ScrollProgress from "stimulus-scroll-progress"

export default class extends ScrollProgress {
  connect() {
    super.connect()
    console.log("Do what you want here.")
  }
}
```

This controller will automatically have access to targets defined in the parent class.

If you override the `connect`, `disconnect` or any other methods from the parent, you'll want to call `super.method()` to make sure the parent functionality is executed.

## Development

$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
```
